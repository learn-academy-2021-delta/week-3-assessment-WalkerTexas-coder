3. JavaScript Events: JS has events that provide a dynamic interface- connected to the DOM. onClick - onLoad -onMouseOver -onChange

4. Object oriented programming: OOP that utilizes classes and methods. Reusable code to structure projects. Creates OBject based elements that are held in hierarchy, methods belong to and manipulate the objects. 

5. Ruby: OOP used for backend server programming; Elegant & Dynamic Open source programming language. Created by Matz-- early 90s
